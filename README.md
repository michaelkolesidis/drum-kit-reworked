# Wes Bos' Drum Kit Reworked
An Drum Kit controlled with keys. 

This is a (mostly aesthetically) reworked verion of the first JavaScript 30 challenge (the drum kit) by Wes Bos. Oh, and it comes with different sounds, as well.

The vast majority of the code is written by Wes Bos.

You can find an improved drum kit (written by me from scratch) here: <a href="https://github.com/michaelkolesidis/electronic-drum-kit">Electronic Drum Kit</a>
